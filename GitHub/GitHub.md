## Create a repo

To put your project up on GitHub, you'll need to create a repository for it to live in.



What's the real difference between a public and a private repository?
- public repository: This repository can be seen by Anyone on the internet.
                     Anyone who wants to make some changes to your repository can fork 
                     it and contribute to your repository in the form of pull requests.
 
- private repository: This repository can be seen only by the people who 
                     you specifically give access to.


<h3> Adding a readme: </h3>
This is the place where you can give a detailed explanation to your project
and if possible the user manual which helps the uses of your project set your
project up instantly on their local machine.

<h3> Adding a .gitignore: </h3>
Adding this file your repository ignores the production files that are also
being commited into the repo.

<h3> Choosing a licence: </h3>
Public repositories on GitHub are often used to share open source software. For your repository to truly be open source, you'll need to license it so that others are free to use, change, and distribute the software.

choosing a right licence:
Github has a webpage called [choosealicence.com][1], to help you understand how to license your code. A software license tells others what they can and can't do with your source code, so it's important to make an informed decision.
